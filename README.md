**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mhollink** (Marcel Hollink). I am a Fullstack Java developer located in The Netherlands. I am currently working [@Quintor](https://github.com/Quintor) in The Hague.

**ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in** anything frontend. I am always looking to improve my skills on both frontend development as well as making the interactions between my frontends and backend go as smoothly as possible.
I am deeply passioned about creating maintable code which is readable, even after not looking at it for a year. 

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning** Kotlin. Since I heared of Kotlin at devoxx BE I slowly developed an intrest into it and am now free to start learning a new tool/language again. Kotlin it is!

*I have a second GitHub account which contains some old school projects & assignments: [@MHHollink](https://github.com/MHHollink)*
