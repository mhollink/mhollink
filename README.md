**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mhollink** (Marcel Hollink). I am a Fullstack developer located in The Netherlands. I am currently working [@Quintor](https://github.com/Quintor) in The Hague. I work with languages like Java & Kotlin in Spring backend application and have quite the toolbelt when it comes to Javascript (NodeJS).  

**ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in** anything frontend. I am always looking to improve my skills on both frontend development as well as making the interactions between my frontends and backend go as smoothly as possible. My aim on frontends is to always create the best UX possible.
I am deeply passioned about creating maintable code which is readable, even after not looking at it for a year. 

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning** new ways to easily create manageable frontends for clients. This year i learned about [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io)

*I have a second GitHub account which contains some old school projects & assignments: [@MHHollink](https://github.com/MHHollink)*
